Beast Ranks Idea (IN PROGRESS)
1. A beast's level will increase by their age but levels will get harder to attain with larger ages.
This will vary between ranks. (KINDA DONE)
(Customizable)
2. A beast can increase their lifespan for every creature they kill. This will vary between ranks.
(Customizable)
3. MAKE THEM OP AF (yes)
4. "Boss" monster spawns, and it could spawn some minions too.
5. The level of the Boss can spawn minions, spawn may be customizable.
6. Whoever kills the Boss can gain some bonuses (all customizable too) like speed/damage etc.
7. I imagine you may even make it be randomized which stat it boosts and how much.
8. Maybe like every 1k years, random boss creature ' rhino, buffalo, hyena ' and killing it can give say damage or speed by 10 or something.

- Added the ability for animals with boss traits to randomly spawn in random parts of the world(this is can be turned on or off in settings)
- Added stat muliplier(this is customizable in the settings)

- Just fixed fire resistance (thanks to nguyenanh for pointing out the error)
Info on how it works:
1. if a unit is below the first level leap(below level 10), then they can't resist the fire at all. They will have to depend on how much health they have to wait out the fire or swim.
2. The effectiveness of the fire resistance depends on the level of the unit.
For example:
A level 10 unit's fire resistance will only prevent damage when the unit's health is at 10%-20%, thus making them have almost no health.
A level 50 unit's fire resistance will only prevent damage when the unit's health is at 50% or so, thus only taking half of his health
