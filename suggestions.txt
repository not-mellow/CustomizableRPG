Beast Ranks Idea (IN PROGRESS)
1. A beast's level will increase by their age but levels will get harder to attain with larger ages.
This will vary between ranks. (KINDA DONE)
(Customizable)
2. A beast can increase their lifespan for every creature they kill. This will vary between ranks.
(Customizable)
3. MAKE THEM OP AF (yes)
4. "Boss" monster spawns, and it could spawn some minions too.
5. The level of the Boss can spawn minions, spawn may be customizable.
6. Whoever kills the Boss can gain some bonuses (all customizable too) like speed/damage etc.
7. I imagine you may even make it be randomized which stat it boosts and how much.
8. Maybe like every 1k years, random boss creature ' rhino, buffalo, hyena ' and killing it can give say damage or speed by 10 or something.
